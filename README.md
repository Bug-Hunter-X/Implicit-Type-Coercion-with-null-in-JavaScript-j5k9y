# Implicit Type Coercion with null in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to implicit type coercion when comparing values with `null`. The strict equality operator (`===`) is crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior in such scenarios.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from using loose equality (`==`) to compare variables with `null`. Loose equality performs type coercion, leading to unexpected results. This is especially problematic when dealing with potentially `null` or `undefined` values.

## Bug Solution

Using the strict equality operator (`===`) ensures that the comparison is made without type coercion. This eliminates the ambiguity and results in consistent, predictable behavior. The solution utilizes `===` to explicitly check for `null` values.
